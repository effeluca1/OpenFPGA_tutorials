# Welcome to OpenFPGA Tutorials
Here we priovide a repository with hands on tutorials on how to use OpenFPGA. 

## Introduction

The award-winning OpenFPGA framework is the first open-source FPGA IP generator with silicon proofs supporting highly-customizable FPGA architectures. OpenFPGA provides complete EDA support for customized FPGAs, including Verilog-to-bitstream generation and self-testing verification. OpenFPGA opens the door to democratizing FPGA technology and EDA techniques with agile prototyping approaches and constantly evolving EDA tools for chip designers and researchers.
